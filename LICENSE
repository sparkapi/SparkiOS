DEVELOPER AGREEMENT

This is an agreement ("Agreement") between Financial Business Systems, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "FBS," "we" or "us") and you, if registering as an individual, or the entity you represent if registering as a business("Developer" or "you") (FBS and Developer shall each be known as a "Party," or collectively, as the "Parties").

Please carefully read this agreement and all terms, rules, policies, documentation and other Developer Guidelines (as defined below) provided by FBS. You accept and agree to the terms of this Agreement on your own behalf or on behalf of your company or organization, by using the Platform in any way.

Definitions. Definitions of certain terms (typically indicated as capitalized terms in the Agreement) are set forth in the Defined Terms at the end of the Agreement. These definitions are an integral part of the Agreement and should be reviewed carefully as you read the Agreement.
Application Submittal, Development, Review and Withdrawal.
Application Submission; Representations. The Platform allows you to submit to FBS a request to sell one or more of your Applications through the Application Store. For each application you submit for review, you shall provide FBS and each MLS using the Platform with access (and continue to provide such access throughout the Term) to the Application for testing and review purposes. You shall also provide FBS with corresponding Application Information (including without limitation a EULA as specified in Section 7.e), and timely updates thereafter throughout the Term. By taking such steps, you represent and warrant that:
The Application complies fully with this Agreement; and
The Application Information is accurate. If any Application Information is inaccurate or otherwise needs to be updated or modified, you shall promptly provide FBS with corrections, updates, or modifications.
Developer Guidelines and Terms. Your Application must be developed in accordance with this Agreement, including:
Compliance with MLS Rules and License Terms regarding MLS Content, including the provisions in Section 5 (License to MLS Content and Platform; Limitations) below;
Single Sign-On authentication of users through the Platform (http://sparkplatform.com/docs/authentication/authentication), which will require End User assent to MLS Member Terms of Use and Consumer Terms of Use as appropriate;
For browser applications, inclusion of the App Bar (http://sparkplatform.com/docs/supporting_documentation/spark_bar_integration);
Each API request from an Application must include the true user-agent in the header of the request as specified at http://sparkplatform.com/docs/api_services/read_first; Developer represents that every request made to the API will accurately include the user-agent making the request;
OAuth access tokens, the Spark API key, and the Spark API secret must never be sent to a web browser. Web applications must not make direct API calls from the web browser and instead must proxy their requests through a server application to ensure the OAuth access is never transmitted to the browser under any circumstances. More generally, OAuth access tokens, the Spark API key, and the Spark API secret must never directly or indirectly be made accessible or transmitted to an end user.
OAuth access tokens, the Spark API key, and the Spark API secret must only be sent to the Spark Platform's servers and transmission of these items must be done using HTTPS.
Desktop and native mobile applications may store or save the OAuth access token, Spark API key, and Spark API secret only if they are encrypted using a strong encryption method before storage.
Desktop and native mobile applications must not store Spark end user usernames and passwords, but instead must use Spark resources to authenticate the user.
If your Application creates, modifies, or otherwise saves the type of content defined in Member Content or Consumer Content, your Application will save that Member Content or Consumer Content to the Platform through the API so it is available to that Member or Consumer without duplicate entry in any other Applications they may license or use through the Platform;
For applications using the Spark API, compliance with the API Documentation (http://sparkplatform.com/docs/api_services/read_first) and API Terms of Use (http://sparkplatform.com/docs/terms_of_use/api), which are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference;
You shall not remove, modify, impair, reverse-engineer or otherwise access or alter any security or analytics component provided or used by FBS; and
Any other requirements outlined in this Agreement.
Review of Applications. FBS may, at its option, review your Application for approval for Application Store distribution. You acknowledge and agree that FBS may, in its sole discretion, reject your Application for distribution in the Application Store for any reason. A decision by FBS to include your Application in the Platform shall not relieve you of responsibility to ensure the Application complies with this Agreement or the Developer Guidelines.
Notice to MLSs; Opportunity to Reject. Upon approval of your Application by FBS, each MLS participating in the Platform will be provided at least two (2) weeks notice of your Application’s availability. You acknowledge and agree that each MLS may, in its sole discretion, reject your Application for distribution in the MLS’s Store for any reason.
Revocation by FBS or MLSs. You understand and agree that FBS or MLS may revoke approval of your Application and withdraw it from the Application Store or MLS Stores, and from otherwise accessing or using the Platform, at any time and for any reason. In the event such revocation arises from a cause not attributable (in FBS’s sole determination) to a fault of Developer, FBS shall process payments to Members and Consumers for Purchases under the cancellation process of Section 4e. If revocation arises from a cause attributable (in FBS’s sole determination) to a fault of Developer, Developer shall be solely responsible for resolving End User support claims and refund requests. Reasons for revocation attributable to the fault of Developer may include without limitation the occurrence of the following events, or FBS’s reasonable determination or belief that the following events may occur:
Your security certificates or keys have been compromised;
Your Application contains malicious or harmful code, malware or viruses;
Your Application is adversely affecting the performance of the Platform, or End User or third party systems, networks or infrastructure;
You have breached any term of this Agreement or have failed to comply with Developer Guidelines (including without limitation failure to comply with confidentiality requirements, MLS Rules and License Terms or limitations stated in Section 5 below); or,
Your Application violates, misappropriates or infringes the rights of any third party.
Withdrawal by Developer. Subject to other terms of this Agreement, you may withdraw an Application or your services from the Platform or from users under the following terms:
You may withdraw an Application from further sale on the Application Store at any time. Following the withdrawal of an Application from the Application Store, you must continue to provide services purchased under a subscription basis and otherwise continue to meet your obligations to users under your EULA.
You may cancel future subscription renewals of Members and Consumers provided you (i) give thirty (30) days notice to each affected Member or Consumer, (ii) you have advised Members and Consumers of your right to cancel subscription renewals in your EULA, and (iii) you continue to provide services already purchased under a subscription basis and otherwise continue to meet your obligations to users under your EULA.
You may terminate the distribution, operation or support of your Application (and any related access or use of the Platform) altogether by providing written notice to FBS, provided you have no further obligation to any Member or Consumer, including ongoing subscriptions held by Members or Consumers.
In the event you lose necessary rights to distribute, operate or support your Application or become aware of a third party claim related to these rights, you shall notify FBS immediately. At your option, you may take any action under (1)-(3) above or otherwise obtain necessary rights to your Application or resolve any third party claim, provided that in any case you acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely responsible for resolving End User support claims and refund requests.
Application Store Operations.
Purchase of Application Licenses Through the Application Store. Subject to FBS’s and the MLSs’ rights to review and remove Applications, you may offer your Application for license through the Application Store for a fee or at no cost and according to other terms you present through an EULA you provide and which the Store will present to the purchaser and require assent before allowing purchase. The EULA cannot conflict with the terms of this Agreement and, to the extent it does, the terms of this Agreement control.
Trial Periods. You may offer a trial period for your Application on the terms allowed in the Application Store.
All Purchases Are Final; Accidental Purchases. Once a payment has been processed, the End User will have 24 hours to cancel the Purchase through the Store, in which case the Purchase will be considered accidental and the purchase price will be refunded by the Store. Once 24 hours have passed, the Purchase will be deemed final and the Developer will become responsible for responding to any requests for refunds of payments already made.
Developer Refunds. Developer shall be responsible for handling all refund requests from Members and Consumers. Developer, at its option, may provide refunds to such Members and Consumers through a refund feature enabled in the Platform. If FBS determines in its sole discretion that Developer is unable to resolve a support claim, FBS may provide a refund to the End User or to otherwise settle the support claim. The total amount of any refund shall be payable in full by Developer, and Developer agrees to reimburse FBS for the full amount of any shortfall in the Developer Account following a refund. FBS shall have no obligation to refund any part of the Transaction Fee collected on a refunded Purchase.
Discretionary Refunds by FBS. In its discretion, FBS may cancel a Purchase and issue a refund in the following circumstances: (i) if it determines that such a cancellation is needed or may be needed to comply with a court order, statute or regulation, or to otherwise avoid a claim, (ii) following an End User chargeback on a Purchase, (iii) by FBS in its discretion in the event an Application is disabled on End User devices or an End User’s subscription terminated due to the withdrawal of MLS Data, or (iv) as otherwise stated under this Agreement.
Subscriptions. You may offer content or access to your Application on a subscription basis. You shall provide all purchased services of your Application through the entire period the subscription is in effect. You understand and agree that End Users may cancel future subscription renewals through the Application Store at any time. Following such a cancellation, you and the Store shall cease all future billing of the End User for that Application, and shall continue to provide content or access to your Application through the remainder of the already-paid subscription term.
In-App Purchases. Your Application may not offer purchases or payment within the Application. All payments for features, content or information provided by your Application must be made through the Store. FBS shall collect payments for all Application Purchases and shall provide payments to Developer according to Section 4.
Advertising. You may provide advertising in your application only through approved providers and according to Developer Guidelines. Your Application may not service third party advertising, whether embedded into your Application or through other means.
Application Support. You are solely responsible for support and maintenance of your Applications and any complaints about your Applications. Your contact information shall be displayed in the Application and Application Store or otherwise made available to End Users for customer support purposes.
End User Comments. You understand and agree that End Users may provide comments, ratings and other feedback through the Application Store regarding your Application, and that FBS and MLS have no responsibility, liability or other obligation regarding such End User Content. FBS and MLS shall each have the right to review and remove such End User comments, ratings or feedback in their sole discretion, and have no obligation to remove negative End User comments, ratings or feedback.
Payments and Reports.
Payment Processing. FBS has selected a Payment Processor to process payments and collect revenue from Purchases. Developer must process all Purchases through the Application Store. For example, an Application may not allow End Users to buy items, information, or services by linking to an external portal or website. FBS shall collect revenue from all Purchases through the Application Store, and shall make payments to Developer on a monthly basis according to the terms of this Section 4.
Payment Calculation. For each month of the calendar year, FBS shall determine the total amount of all Purchases of Developer Applications through the Application Store, then deduct any cancellation fees under Section 4.e, refunds under Section 4.f, charge backs, sales taxes and the transaction processing fees (approximately 3%) charged by the payment gateway and related credit card processing entities. FBS shall retain a Transaction Fee of 30% of such remaining revenue and shall make a payment of 90% of such remaining revenue to Developer if the Application does not use the listings API (in which case any use of listing data in the Application will need to be independently procured direct from the MLS) and 70% of the revenue if the Application uses the listings API. No payment or credit shall be made to Developer for Applications with a list price of $0.00.
Payment Frequency. FBS shall make payments to Developer for any given month within thirty (30) days of the end of that month. FBS shall be entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amount due to Developer is at least $10.00(US).
Taxes. FBS shall be responsible for determining if an Application is taxable and the applicable tax rate to collect for each taxing jurisdiction where Application is sold. FBS shall further be responsible for remitting taxes to the appropriate taxing authority.
Right to Withhold, Offset. FBS shall have the right to offset any Transaction Fee amount previously paid or due by you, or require you to remit any such amount to FBS, if FBS issues a refund or credit to an End User or otherwise receives a chargeback.
Other Payment Terms. FBS shall make payments under Section 4.b above to Developer by EFT to a Developer bank account, or otherwise according to payment terms agreed by the Parties. Developer shall be responsible for any income or other taxes due and payable resulting from FBS payments to Developer. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, the amounts due to you hereunder are inclusive of any taxes that may apply to such payments. FBS maintains the right, however, to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes payable by you from amounts due from us, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, shall constitute full payment to you.
Reports. FBS shall provide Developer with access to sales reports in the Platform that track each Purchase transaction.
Audit Rights. FBS shall maintain detailed records of Application Store Purchase transactions and other events upon which monthly payments to Developer are calculated under Section 4.b above. Upon Developer’s request and no more than twice during any twelve (12) month period, FBS shall make such records available to Developer in any electronic format reasonably requested. FBS shall bear the costs of collecting and delivering (in electronic format) such records to Developer.
Billing Issues. You must report any claims or issues related to billing, transaction fees or monthly reports within six (6) months after the date of the report, bill or payment, or any such claim or issue shall be considered waived by you.
License to MLS Content and Platform; Limitations.
MLS Content.

You shall provide any assistance reasonably requested by FBS or an MLS in remedying such breach. Your obligations to report and enforce the Applicable Terms shall survive termination of this Agreement or your use of the Platform.
All applications, hardware hosting facilities, and server software must be secured using industry standard best practices (might need more details here) to prevent unauthorized access to content provided by the Spark API.

Platform Operations and Usage Terms.
Platform Operations. FBS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Platform available and responsive at all times, including by providing redundant data centers. Developer understands and acknowledges that the Platform may be unavailable at times due to failures in the ordinary course, updates and maintenance, and failure of MLSs to provide MLS Content. You understand and agree that the Platform relies on various MLSs to provide MLS Content, for which FBS does not guarantee the quality of content or continued availability. MLS further may choose to withhold MLS Content from you or FBS at any time. FBS shall in no case be responsible for outages, downtime or other errors in the Platform attributable to MLSs failure to, or decision not to, provide MLS Content.

However, you understand and agree there may be breaking changes FBS is required to make to the Platform and such mitigating steps shall not be required of FBS in such cases.
